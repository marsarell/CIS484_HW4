A calculator GUI 

Functionality:  A calculator that adds, subtracts, divides, and multiplys. Includes a  “ticker tape” of 
past entries into the calculator, with the ability to both save the contents of the tape as a record of 
their work, and to be able to load a file that contains this data into the calculator so they can pick 
up where they left off.
